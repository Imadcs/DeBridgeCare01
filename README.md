# 💠 DeBridgeCare – Transparent Cross‑Chain Aid Distribution

DeBridgeCare is a decentralized platform that bridges **Solana** and **Qubic** to deliver verified humanitarian aid. Donors pledge funds on Solana, verifiers submit proof, Qubic validates via quorum logic and funds are released only upon verified delivery—with recipients receiving NFT badges as proof.

---

## 🚨 Problem

Humanitarian aid often suffers from mismanagement, fraud and lack of visibility. Donors—including NGOs, DAOs, and individuals, cannot verify whether aid reaches recipients.

---

## ✅ Solution

DeBridgeCare provides:

1. **Fund locking** on Solana via smart contracts.      
2. **Submission of delivery proof** (photo, GPS, QR code).  
3. **Quorum-based validation** using Qubic logic.  
4. **Conditional fund release** and NFT badge issuance on verified delivery.

This ensures a **trustless, transparent, and cross-chain** aid distribution process.

## 🧪 Proof of Concept

- Frontend UI mockups: Donor, Verifier, Recipient screens  
- Solana smart contract stubs using Rust & Anchor  
- Mock bridge built with Node.js  
- Quorum logic simulated via Qubic scripting  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** Solana, Qubic  
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust, Anchor, Qubic scripting  
- **Bridge Logic:** Node.js  
- **Frontend Mocks:** React/Tailwind CSS  
- **Build Environment:** Docker (for SBF builds)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Imadcs/DeBridgeCare_Qubictrack.git
   cd DeBridgeCare_Qubictrack

2. Build Solana contract (in Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/project -w /project solanalabs/solana:v1.18.15 bash
   cargo build-sbf
3. Run Node.js bridge:
   ```bash
   cd bridge
   npm install
   npm start

## 🌐 Use Cases

- **Disaster Relief (e.g., Sindh Floods)**  
  Donors pledge funds in USDC. Local responders provide geotagged photo or QR-code confirmation. When Qubic verifies delivery via quorum, funds are released and recipients receive NFT proof badges.

- **NGO/DAO Controlled Aid**  
  Organizations can lock funds in Solana, allowing ground teams to submit proof of aid delivery. Qubic-enabled validation ensures accountability before funds are released.

- **Proof of Impact for Donors**  
  Donors receive on-chain confirmation via a receipt, demonstrating that the aid reached real recipients.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

1. Launch full **Qubic transaction-layer bridge**  
2. Integrate **privacy-preserving identity** for recipients  
3. Develop **mobile-first UX** for field agents  
4. Establish **NGO partnerships** for real-world deployment
